				<h2>PINGU FACTS</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Pingu was born in 1984</li>
					<li>More than one billion people have seen PINGU on 140 different TV stations</li>
					<li>PINGU is currently being broadcast on BBC and CBeebies in the UK</li>
					<li>The characters in PINGU speak in &ldquo;penguinese&rdquo;</li>
					<li>Pingu lives in the Antarctic</li>
					<li>Pingu's world is populated solely by penguins and other animals, there are no humans there.</li>
					<li>Robby the seal is Pingu’s best friend.</li>
					<li>If Pingu is upset or angry, his beak trumpets out to show he’s really cross "noo, noo!"</li>
					<li>As a big brother, Pingu always makes a fuss when he has to look after his little sister Pinga, but he secretly loves taking care of her.</li>
					<li>Pingu also reads picture books, listens to music and invents his own imaginary games with anything he finds lying around.</li>
					<li>Pingu is also very handy on a sledge and loves his blue push-along scooter.</li>
					<li>Like any growing penguin, Pingu has a healthy appetite and will guzzle spare fish whenever he finds one.</li>
					<li>Pingu always finds some new activity to join in with - he loves skiing, ice hockey, curling and any kind of physical game.</li>
					<li>He is competitive and does not like to be on the losing team or left out of the fun.</li>
					<li>Pingu also has a tendency to want to be in the spotlight and can get grumpy if he thinks he’s not getting enough attention.</li>
					<li>Pinga is Pingu’s three year old baby sister - she loves her big brother and always tags along when he’s around.</li>
					<li>Pinga is adorable and loved by all, although she is capable of throwing quite a tantrum when something upsets her.</li>
					<li>Pinga loves her toy rabbit, which she carries with her everywhere and she often carries a little bag too.</li>
					<li>Pinga isn’t old enough to go to school with Pingu so she goes to the nursery instead.</li>
					<li>Pingu’s dad is the local postman.</li>
					<li>A real renaissance penguin, Dad does the ironing or the knitting at home if Mother is busy.</li>
					<li>Grandfather lives a short snowcart trip away from Pingu’s igloo.</li>
					<li>Robby is Pingu’s best friend – and that means double trouble!</li>
					<li>Pingu's favourite method of transport is riding on the back of his Dad’s snowcart.</li>
					<li>The belief that penguins topple over as they watch airplanes fly overhead is actually false. Penguins are far too clever to fall for that...</li>
					<li>One type of penguin you certainly won’t find in the Antarctic is the Fairy Penguin. These cute little penguins can only be found on the southern coasts of Australia and New Zealand.</li>
					<li>Macaroni penguins get their name from the song “Yankee Doodle Dandy,” about a soldier with a brightly feathered cap. They certainly have the most flamboyant hairstyle of any penguin...</li>
					<li>The oldest known fossil of a penguin is roughly 62 million years old. Like today’s penguins, they had short, slim wings suitable only for diving... no flying!</li>
					<li>Penguins will usually walk when on dry land. However, when they get tired, they will toboggan on their bellies..</li>
					<li>In the search for food, penguins walk for many miles, following each other’s footsteps. Hungry and cold they march on, their quest a very serious one..</li>
					<li>The dialogue in Pingu is improvised by voice artists Marcello Magni and David Sant</li>
					<li>Prop makers for the show mould on average 400 penguin flippers per week.</li>
					<li>It takes a whole day to animate just 8 seconds of Pingu.</li>
					<li>In one day 200 separate tiny movements will be animated.</li>
					<li>Pingu loves fish ... mmmmm fish!</li>
					<li>Pingu likes sledging, snowball fights and getting air on his snowboard!</li>
					<li>Pingu likes sledging, and getting air on his snowboard!</li>
					<li>Ewwwww Fish Porridge! Pingu can't stand it!!</li>
